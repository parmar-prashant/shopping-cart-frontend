# The Big Phone Store - Front Test Project

This project uses Vue 3, Tailwind CSS framework with no external libraries.

## Folder Structure

The project has the basic folder structure as of a Vue 3 template with the following sub-directories in the *src* folder:

- *Components Folder*:
  - *Custom*: This folder holds the custom UI components for use across the various components for better code reusability and maintenance e.g. Modal Popup.
  - *Shared*: This folder holds the custom shared components for use within a single component or across different components e.g. Thumbnail viewer.
  - *Skeleton*: This folder holds the custom components such as a header, footer, body and navigation panel for better structuring of the application.
- *Product.vue*: Component used to display product details with media and textual information.
- *ProductImage.vue*: Component used to display product media files in a slider form.
- *ProductDetail.vue*: Component used to display textual information of a product.
